Yanwte stands for yet another way to extend. It's a library to help you extending your programs. This library is written in Kotlin, and is compatible with JDK 1.6. Yanwte came out of the need from the inside of Alibaba inc, the trading department. It's online trading systems are using the framework called tradespi, which is the predecestor of Yanwte. 3 years since the inception of tradespi, I felt it's time to rewrite it and open source it to the community, so that we can share a mature thought of how to extend a complex program to everyone. Tradespi has been tested by 3 tmall double 11 festivals. I believe Yanwte can achieve the same quality. To ensure the performance, Yanwte doesn't have any reflection calls and method calls are known time consuming (like `String.replace`).
